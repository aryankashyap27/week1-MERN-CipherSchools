HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of a web page. It uses a system of tags to define and describe the content on a web page. Here's an overview of HTML with some examples:

Basic HTML Structure:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
<html>: The root element of an HTML page.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as character set and viewport settings.
<meta>: Defines metadata, like character set and viewport configuration.
<title>: Sets the title of the web page, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
<body>: Contains the content of the HTML document.
